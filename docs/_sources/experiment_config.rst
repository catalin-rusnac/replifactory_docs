Experiment Setup Guide
======================

Initial Setup
-------------

   - Select an existing experiment or create a new one in the 'Experiment' tab.
   - Creating a new experiment will duplicate the parameters of the current experiment.
   - To start a new experiment with default parameters, choose "default template" from the drop-down menu.

Stock Bottles Preparation
--------------------------

   - Use aseptic technique to maintain sterility.
   - Be mindful of airflow to avoid contamination.
   - Consider your hands as potential contamination sources; imagine they are covered in glitter you don't want in the bottle.

Priming the Tubing
------------------

   - Go to the 'Device' tab.
   - Pump medium through the tubing until it reaches the needle.
   - Start with Pump2 Vial7 - prime the drug tubing while the vial is still empty.
   - If drug is pumped through the needle during priming, tilt the vial and use the waste pump to eliminate all medium from the vial.
   - Use a magnet to position the stirrer bar near the waste needle and pump out every remaining drop.
   - When vial7 is primed, move on to Pump2 Vial6 and so on. For the remaining vials approximately 0.25mL should be pumped to fill the tube segment that passes through the valve.
   - For priming Pump1 tubing, also start with Vial 7. First pump medium until it reaches the tip of the needle (about 4mL). Then, pump medium into the vial until it reaches the tip of the waste needle (~12mL). Record the pumped volume - this is the vial volume.
   - For the remaining vials, pump vial_volume + 0.25mL to fill the vial and tubing segment that passes through the valve.
   - Check for leaks and ensure that the tubing is properly connected in the process.


Setting Up Experiment Parameters
--------------------------------

   - Go to the 'Prediction' tab.
   - Set the parameters for the experiment.
   - Check predicted plots to ensure the experiment is set up correctly.
   - Refer to the :doc:`culture_parameters` for a detailed explanation of each parameter

Starting the Experiment
-----------------------

   - Go to the 'Experiment' tab.
   - Click the 'Start' button.

Monitoring the Experiment
-------------------------

   - Check the 'Experiment' tab for the current status of the experiment and the latest data.
   - Update parameters in 'Prediction' tab if necessary
   - Check the 'Status' tab for a photo of the device to check for leaks, biofilm formation, or other issues.
